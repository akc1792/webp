<h1 id="para"> ...ABOUT MOTHER'S...</h1>
<div>
<pre>
<p> 
There are times only when a Mother's love
Can understand our tears,
Can soothe our disappointments
And calm all our fears.

There are times when only a Mother's Love
Can share the joy we feel
When something we've dreamed about
Quite suddenly is real.

There are times when only a Mother's faith
Can help on life's way
And inspire in us the confidence
We need from day to day.

For a Mother's heart and a Mother's faith
And a Mother's steadfast love
Were fashioned by the Angels
And sent from God above.

The sun in you're heart will continue,
To shine in the future in all you do.
The most special person in my life by far,
I'm happy to say is you!</p></pre>
</div>
<pre>
<p>
Since the moment I entered this world,
You have cared for me like no other.
There is only one word to describe you,
That is in every way a perfect Mother.

In the years you have watched me grow
So many memories we can now replay.
You've been there to love and protect me,
From my birth to this very day.

When there's a cloud covering my path,
Or a problem I am about to face.
You'll be the one wipe away my tears,
And put everything back in its place.

Your warm touch is one of a kind,
So gentle to send me to sleep.
Your voice is one of an angels,
A beauty only you deserve to keep.

The way you always make me smile
And the way you play with my hair.
When I need to talk, you'll put me first,
So I know how much you care.
